COMMON
~~~~~~

GeeXboX libplayer is a multimedia A/V abstraction layer API.
Its goal is to interact with Enna Media Center.

libplayer provides a generic A/V API that relies on various
multimedia player for Linux systems.
It currently supports MPlayer, xine, GStreamer and VLC.

DEVELOPERS
~~~~~~~~~~

Build using traditional ./configure && make commands.
Try ./configure --help for list of available build options
and audio/video engines bindings.

libplayer uses GNU Coding Standards as default indentation and code style.
Please always conform to this standard before applying your changes.

In order to provide a minimalistic player dependancy
towards frontends, only the abstraction layer has to be exported.
ALWAYS consider player.h as the ONLY public header.
Private definitions have to go to player_internals.h
NEVER include other headers in .h files, always do so in .c files.
NEVER use printf(), always use pl_log().
Check your code for warnings before commits.

Versioning policy
--
The major version means no backward compatibility to previous versions (e.g.
removal of a function from the public API). The minor version means backward
compatible change (e.g. addition of a function to the public API or extension
of an existing data structure). The micro version means a noteworthy binary
compatible change (e.g. new wrapper).
