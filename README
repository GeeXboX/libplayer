COMMON
~~~~~~

GeeXboX libplayer is a multimedia A/V abstraction layer API.
Its goal is to interact with GeeXboX Open Media Center (OMC).

libplayer provides a generic A/V API that relies on various
multimedia player for Linux systems.
It currently supports xine and VLC only.
More bindings (MPlayer, GStreamer, ...) are bound to come some day.

DEVELOPERS
~~~~~~~~~~

Build using traditional ./configure && make commands.
Try ./configure --help for list of available build options
and audio/video engines bindings.

libplayer comes with a regression tests toolkit called regtest-libplayer.
Use it to validate your code before each modification to libplayer.
If you add new functions to libplayer, ALWAYS add them
to regtest-libplayer.c too.

libplayer uses GNU Coding Standards as default indentation and code style.
Please always conform to this standard before applying your changes.

In order to provide a minimalistic player dependancy
towards frontends, only the abstraction layer has to be exported.
ALWAYS consider player.h as the ONLY public header.
Private definitions have to go to player_internals.h
NEVER include other headers in .h files, always do so in .c files.
NEVER use printf(), always use plog().
Check your code for warnings before commits.
